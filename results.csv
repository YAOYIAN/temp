Alright, so I have this query where someone wants me to act as a highly emotionally intelligent and experienced sales expert and customer service specialist. They're asking for answer templates based on product category and customer inquiries. The placeholders are aspect1, aspect2, etc., product name, space for external knowledge, subjective opinion, neutral opinion, and negative opinion.

The example they provided is pretty clear. It starts with a greeting, acknowledges the space (which I assume is where external info goes), then lists aspects of the product, mentions what users think—positive, neutral, and negative points.

Now, applying this to their specific case: the product category is Electronics, and the customer question is whether a mouse works with most PC laptops. They want an extremely concise template without any extra fluff or speculative info.

Hmm, so I need to structure the response around these placeholders. The greeting should be friendly but professional. Then, insert external knowledge—maybe something about compatibility standards. Next, list aspects of the product, like compatibility and ease of use. Then mention what users commonly say: subjective (positive), neutral, and negative opinions.

Wait, how do I ensure it's concise? Maybe just outline each section without expanding too much. Let me try drafting that.

Start with ""Dear customer, $<space$>."" Then summarize the question by listing aspects like compatibility and ease of use. After that, talk about the product and include user opinions—optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic viewpoints.

I think that's the structure they're looking for. It needs to be a general outline without specific details, just placeholders. So I'll make sure each section is clearly marked with the appropriate placeholder tags.

Dear customer, $<space$>, here is a summary of your question: Firstly, $<aspect1$>, secondly, $<aspect2$>. Regarding the $<product$> you mentioned, many users agree $<subjective opinion$>, however, some feel $<neutral opinion$> and $<negative opinion$>."

Okay, I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a sales and customer service expert. They provided an example of how they want the response structured with placeholders like aspect1, product, space, etc. The product category is Office Products, specifically about Brother cartridges.

First, I need to break down the customer's question. They're asking if the cartridges are 3 colors: yellow, blue, and magenta. Then they inquire if these are genuine Brother cartridges. Lastly, they question whether they should come vacuum-packed.

I should create a template that addresses each of these points concisely. The user emphasized brevity, so I need to make sure each part is covered without extra fluff. 

Looking at the example provided, it starts with a greeting, inserts external knowledge, summarizes the aspects, and includes subjective, neutral, and negative opinions. So I'll follow that structure.

For aspect1, it's about color options. The product is Brother cartridges, so I'll note that. Space can be used for any additional info, like compatibility or quality. Subjective opinion should highlight a positive, like vibrant colors. Neutral might mention cost differences between genuine and compatible. Negative could address potential quality concerns with non-genuine products.

I need to ensure placeholders are correctly placed without parentheses. The response must be clear and helpful, addressing all parts of the customer's query.

Okay, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to generate an answer template for a customer's question about a product in the Home and Kitchen category. The specific questions are whether the product is powered by electricity or hand and if it's suitable for grinding up to 20 lbs a day for livestock.

First, I need to understand the structure they want. They provided an example with placeholders like $<$aspect1$>$, $<$product$>$, etc. So, my template needs to include these placeholders appropriately.

The customer’s inquiry has two aspects: power source and daily usage capacity. That translates to aspect1 and aspect2 in the template. The product name will be a placeholder as well. 

They also mentioned including external knowledge with $<$space$>$. That probably means adding some general information or context, like typical uses of such grinders.

Then there are subjective opinions: optimistic, neutral, and negative. I need to structure these so each viewpoint is represented clearly but concisely. The user emphasized being extremely concise, so no extra fluff.

I should make sure the template starts with a greeting, summarizes the question by listing aspects, then addresses each part of their inquiry. Each aspect gets its own line with relevant opinions and external info.

Wait, they mentioned not to add parentheses or speculative info. So I need to keep it straightforward without any extra explanations. Just placeholders in the correct order.

Putting it all together: Greeting, summary of question points, then for each aspect, include external knowledge and the three types of opinions. Make sure each section is clearly separated but brief.

I think that's about it. The template should be easy to fill out with specific details when needed.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this customer's question about whether the product needs to be used in a corner and if it would look odd against a wall. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly the customer is asking. They're concerned about the placement of a Home and Kitchen product—specifically, whether it must be placed in a corner or if positioning it against a wall would make it look out of place. This suggests they might be worried about aesthetics and functionality depending on where the item is placed.

Next, I should consider what aspects of the product are relevant here. Placement flexibility comes to mind immediately because that's what the customer is asking about. Another aspect could be the design or style of the product since how it looks in different placements would affect their decision. Maybe also usability, as placement can impact how easy it is to use the product.

Now, thinking about external knowledge I might need. For example, if the product has a specific shape or feature that makes corner placement ideal, or if it's designed to be wall-mounted, that could influence the answer. On the other hand, if the product is versatile and can fit anywhere without looking odd, that’s also useful information.

Then there are the subjective, neutral, and negative opinions. Some users might love how it looks in a corner and think it's perfect there (subjective), others might say it works fine against a wall but nothing special (neutral), and some could mention it looks awkward when not in a corner (negative).

Putting this all together, I need to structure the answer template in a way that addresses each of these points concisely. The customer wants a clear summary without extra fluff, so I'll make sure each part is covered briefly but effectively.

I also have to remember to use the placeholders as specified: $<aspect1>$ for placement flexibility, $<product>$ for the product name, and then insert external knowledge in the space placeholder. After that, include the subjective, neutral, and negative opinions to give a balanced view.

Let me make sure I don't add any extra information or parentheses, keeping it straightforward as per the instructions. The goal is to provide a template that's easy to fill out with specific details when needed.
